
This script searches for private keys in a wallet.dat file. 
Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Dash, wallet.dat.

It looks for a specific magic pattern (`ckey!` "crypted key") 
and extracts the private keys that come before it. 

It uses the "base58" library to encode the private keys 
in Base58 format and includes a checksum. 

The script reads the file in chunks (`readlength`) 
and searches for the magic pattern in each chunk. 

It utilizes multiprocessing to speed up the process 
by dividing the file into chunks and searching for keys in 
parallel using multiple CPU cores. 

The extracted private keys are then saved to a file named "WIF-KEYS.txt".
